# Wordpress Website

This is a website for a company named "Maa Fabricators". This is a metal fabrication company, situated in kolkata.






## Deployment

I have deployed this project on Hostinger's shared hosting / Wordpress hosting platform.

Below are the steps for hosting any wordpress website in hostingers shared hosting platform.






- **Step 1 -**  First buy domain, hosting and make necessary settings.
- **Step 2 -** Make a zip file of your project and also export your database files from [phpmyadmin](https://locallhost.me/phpmyadmin).
- **Step 3 -** Login into your hostinger account then go to file management, from there go to "public_html" file then upload your zip file here and unzip it.
- **Step 4 -** Now Create a database , from there go to phpmyadmin panel provided by hostinger and import your database file here.
- **Step 5 -** Now in your "public_html" folder, you will found a file named "wp-config". You have to edit database name, username, password present in this file with your recently created database credentials.
- **Step 6 -**   Then in your database files you will found a file named "wp_options", here you have to change site_url and home option_value with the link of the website.
- **Step 7 -** This is the final step, now go to wordpress admin -> go to settings -> go to parmalinks -> press save.

Now your website is live , everyone can view your website. Happy Coding!
